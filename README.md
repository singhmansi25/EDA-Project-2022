# Fire Incidents Analysis Project

The dataset includes Fire incidents as defined by the Ontario Fire Marshal related to Toronto, having information starting from 2011 to 2018.
Toronto Fire Services (TFS) provides fire protection, technical rescue services, hazardous materials response, and first responder emergency medical assistance in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Toronto Fire Services is currently the largest municipal fire department in Canada.

This dataset has some interesting columns such as Estimated Dollar Loss, Latitude and Longitude, Exact time, and date etc.
I will use this dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization along with preparing a Tableau Dashboard.
